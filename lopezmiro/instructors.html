        - remove all inline styles
        - remoe any HTML file that is empty and not going to be used
        - double check all aria-labelledby attributes, as some are not pointing to any existing elements with that particular ID value
        - check your element names, as some do not exist, such as <p1>
        - image alt descriptions should describe the image, rather than make a general statement like "this is x."
        - mind you implicit content hierarchy with headings, as you are repeating the use of the h1, which is typically used just for the title of the page. From thereon, start at h2 for a new section of the page.
        - use the main element to wrap the main content of the page. In this case, if you are only going to have one content area, you actually wouldn't need a section. But, it may be good to keep it if you plan on expanding the main content to include another topic/section

            <p> Joseph: Joseph is the founder of our Swim School, and he acts as a subsititute for any emergencies. Joseph founded the school because as a child he nearly drowned at a friends birthday party, and the next week he was placed into swim lessons by his parents. It started a life long love of the water, where he eventually became a national champion in college and figured the best way to continue his passion would be to share it qwith others.</p>
            <p> Dylan: Dylan was a college swimmer who wanted to be able to stay involved in the sport, and enjoys working with kids, so that lead him to us. He loves watching the children learn and develop a healthy relationship with the water.</p>
            <p>Lauren: Lauren was also a college swimmer, who majored in early development. She worked at a local hosipital for a few years, but ended up missing the water, and teaching children is the best of both worlds.</p>
