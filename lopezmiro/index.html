            <h1>About the Swim School</h1> 
            <p1>The Swim School was created in order to foster a love for the water and raise awareness about the risks of water safety in the community.
            We aim to achieve this goal by creating a safe, and caring atmosphere where parents and children can begin to become comfortable with the water.
