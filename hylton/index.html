        SUMMATIVE COMMENTS: These apply to the other pages too.
        - Check your indentation and spacing throughout. For example,
            - note how your page header is indented twice over from the body
            - note the empty space in page header after the <p>
            - note how your first image's srcset doesn't match the other attributes
        - skip link is ok in the header. However, technically it should be the verry first element inside the body. Also, since there is no ID of "main" the skip link doesn't navigate the user anywhere.
        - Relying too much on aria-label, when you have headings to use with aria-labelledby
        - Would have liked to see more placeholder content to gather a better sense of your plan and design. Don't forget about those lorem ipsum shortcuts and the image placeholders too. I only required about 3 full images for the first phase of the course.
