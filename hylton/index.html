                    <h3>Happy Place by Emily Henry</h3>
                    <h4>My Rating and Review</h4>
                    <p>
                        Emily Henry is more than a romance writer. Her work contains complex characters that represent everyday people. This allows readers to better connect with her characters and become more invested in the stories. Happy Place is a perfect example of this. Happly Place is for people-pleasers. People who constantly put others before themselves and always find themselves being mediators Happy Place is for hopeless romantics who believe in second chances and true love. Happy Place is for people like me who love with their entire hearts. This is my book of the year because I can't stop thinking about it. I've read it a total of three times this year, and I know I'll read it again in 2024. It's a story that never gets old and one that has more depth each time you read it. With every reread, I notice something new or appreciate something new. I don't think I will ever get tired of this book. This was easily a 5/5 star read for me.
