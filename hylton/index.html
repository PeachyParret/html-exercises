        Spot the indentaiton and opening-closing issues throughout, such as below with the div.container that is never closed, its children: header, then another opened div inside the header, which isn't defining/distinguishing another unit of content from another, so the header is sufficient.

        You can check your structure/hierarchies with the breadcrumb menu at the top of your editor. It will list out the structure for you to orient yourself and spot any unwanted structural relationships.

        ALso, be sure to know what you're copy-pasting, as the div with that class tells me that you may have found something to draw from initially. That practice will trip up anyone who's new to the practice, since it can be hard to know why or if that code should actually be there.

        I rec. the following:

        header
            - h1
            - p

        If you add more to you page's header later, you can totally use <div>s to distinguish let's say an image(s) from textual content.
