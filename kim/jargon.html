        <p> This is a great starting point to start to understand common words that people use in the gym that you would otherwise not encounter.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                    Excercise= a bodily movement that is produced by a contraction of muscles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rep= Shortened word for "repetition", A single execution of a chosen exercise. Ie:one pushup=1 rep of pushups
                </li>
                <li>
                    Set= A collection of reps, usually with a rest between each collection. 3 sets of 3 reps of pushups= 9 total pushups
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rest= The time you take between sets to recoup before doing another. usually between 30 sec to 3 min, this is the time to breathe and take a sip of water.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Form= the biokinetic sequence of movements that your body needs to move in order to utilize the proper muscles, joints, and ligaments in order to execute an excercise. Somones form should be consistant between reps and sets. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hypertrophy/Hypertrophic= A method/ style of working out that maxxes out the stimulus to make muscles grow.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS)= The expierence you can get if you overwork your muscles and produce too much lactic acid in your muscles, which leads to extreme soreness in that muscle group a few days after the workout. 
                </li>
                <li> 
                    (to) failure= pushing a set so far that you physically/mentally cannot perform another rep even with extreme effort. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reps in Reserve (RIR)= the amount of reps you could do before you hit failure. This is a way to gauge how intense a set is, a good rule of thumb is to be within 2 RIR for most excersizes. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Time under tension (TUT)=the amount of time that a muscle group is activated during a rep and set, generally having higher TUT increases hypertophy but also could increase lactic acid whcih could lead to DOMS.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pump= The sensation when your muscles are swollen with the amount of blood rushing through them, making them temporariy larger. This is usually a good sign tht you are working out with enough intensity to stimulate muscle growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Push= a group of excersizes which consists of upper body muscles which are used to move things away from the body like the triceps and chest.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pull=a group of excersizes which constits of upper body muscles which are used to move things inward to the body like the biceps and back. 
                </li>
             </ul>
