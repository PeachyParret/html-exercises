                Hello, welcome to my crashcourse to getting swole (learning how to work out). In this web guide we will be diving into some common jargon you will hear in a gym, the form of the three main movements (squat, bench, deadlift), and then a FAQ. I hope you enjoy!
            </p>
            <p>
                Firstly before we touch the iron, I would recomend warming up. A good warmup consists of light cardio and dynamic stretches. The goal is to get the blood pumping around the body and to loosen up the muscles and joints in order to prevent injury. Personally, I ride a bicycle to the gym to do this.

            <h3 id="example">SQUAT</h3>

            </p>
            <p>
                The key mental queue for a sucessful squat is to try to keep your back vertical throughout the movement. Also keep your chin up.
            </p>
            <h3 id="example">BENCH</h3>

            </p>
            <p>
                The key mental queue for a sucessful bench press is to make a right angle with your elbows and head, with your head being the center of the right angle. Also when the bar lowers aim for the bottom of your sternum (or the bottom point where your ribs connect to the front of your chest).
            </p>
            <h3 id="example">DEADLIFT</h3>

            </p>
            <p>
                The key mental queue for a sucessful deadlift is to hindge from the hips, similarly to sitting down the the very ledge of a chair.

            <dl>
                <dt>Rep</dt>
                <dd>Shortened word for "repetition", A single execution of a chosen exercise. Ie:one pushup=1 rep of pushups. </dd>

                <dt>Set</dt>
                <dd>A collection of reps, usually with a rest between each collection. 3 sets of 3 reps of pushups= 9 total pushups. </dd>

                <dt>Rest</dt>
                <dd>The time you take between sets to recoup before doing another. usually between 30 sec to 3 min, this is the time to breathe and take a sip of water.</dd>

                <dt>Form</dt>
                <dd>The biokinetic sequence of movements that your body needs to move in order to utilize the proper muscles, joints, and ligaments in order to execute an excercise. Somones form should be consistant between reps and sets. </dd>

                <dt>Hypertrophy/Hypertrophic</dt>
                <dd>A method/ style of working out that maxxes out the stimulus to make muscles grow.</dd>

                <dt>Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS)</dt>
                <dd>The expierence you can get if you overwork your muscles and produce too much lactic acid in your muscles, which leads to extreme soreness in that muscle group a few days after the workout. </dd>

                <dt>(To) Failure</dt>
                <dd>pushing a set so far that you physically/mentally cannot perform another rep even with extreme effort.</dd>

                <dt>Reps in Reserve (RIR)</dt>
                <dd>the amount of reps you could do before you hit failure. This is a way to gauge how intense a set is, a good rule of thumb is to be within 2 RIR for most excersizes. </dd>

                <dt>Time under tension (TUT)</dt>
                <dd>the amount of time that a muscle group is activated during a rep and set, generally having higher TUT increases hypertophy but also could increase lactic acid whcih could lead to DOMS.</dd>

                <dt>Pump</dt>
                <dd>The sensation when your muscles are swollen with the amount of blood rushing through them, making them temporariy larger. This is usually a good sign tht you are working out with enough intensity to stimulate muscle growth.</dd>

                <dt>Push</dt>
                <dd>a group of excersizes which consists of upper body muscles which are used to move things away from the body like the triceps and chest.</dd>

                <dt>Pull</dt>
                <dd>a group of excersizes which constits of upper body muscles which are used to move things inward to the body like the biceps and back. </dd>

            <h2 id="FAQ">F-A-Q</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Question: Can I workout?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Answer: Of course! Working out is for anyone and everyone. The most important thing is to go at your own pace and to have fun.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Question: What do I do if I'm afriad to go to the gym?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Answer: A common misconseption is that the gym is a scary place where it seems like everyone is judging you. In reality, practically everyone who goes to the gym is going for the same goal as you: self-improvement and development. So, gymgoers are generally very curtious and supportive people!

                    Question: How do I find a gym that works for me?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Answer: Practically all gyms allow you to tour the facilities before you sign up for a membership, the majority of them also have one-day guest passes. Because of this you can try out any number of gyms and find the best fit for you before investing in a full membership.
