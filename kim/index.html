    - A11Y: Your screencast with Voiceover doesn't use the rotor menu. If you approach the screenreader as a user test, then you will catch the following issues
        - skip link is missing and needs to be the very first element/child of the body
        - none of your ARIA labels are working, since the values of aria-labelledby attributes are an elements ID. Since you do not create an ID on any element to link the ARIA label with existing comment, the landmark will not be labeled.
        - sectioning/landmark elements: Consider your user of <header> everywhere. Is everything really a header, i.e., preface to the content that follows it in the source order? Instead, consider section with the role region. If everything's a banner, that's confusing for screenreader users.
        - nav menu is needed across your pages
        - Hierarchical relations:
            - consider how the banner of the page should not be placed within the main
            - Indentation: numerous places need to consider the hierarchy and revise the indentation to account for the inter-relations

            Going to the gym is for EVERYONE, no matter age, gender, and ability. Weightlifting can have amazing health benefits for all. Do not be detered from the gym because you feel you will get too bulky, "toning" is actully a different way of saying reducing body fat AND replacing it with muscle mass!

            Warming up is arguably just as important as the actual workout. If you were to just jump straight into a hard excersise, at best you will not perform well, at worse you can seriously injure yourself leading to weeks of recovery and physical therapy. No one wants that!
        </p>
        <p>
            Warming up is anything that gets your muscles moving and blood pumping. This could range from performing a set of the excersize you are about to do with very light weight or low intensity cardio. A good way to start would be to walk on the treadmill for 5-10 min before starting to pump iron.
        </p>
        <p>
            Personally I try to ride my bike to the gym to warm up, it is both relaxing and a relatively low level of cardio which gets me moving before getting ready to start lifting.

        <P>
            After you have warmed up learn how to perform the core 3 excersizes that will get you started working out! <a href="form.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
