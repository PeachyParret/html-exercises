                         Warming up is arguably just as important as the actual workout. If you were to just jump straight into a hard excersise, at best you will not perform well, at worse you can seriously injure yourself leading to weeks of recovery and physical therapy. No one wants that! 
                         </p>
                         <p>
                            Warming up is anything that gets your muscles moving and blood pumping. This could range from performing a set of the excersize you are about to do with very light weight or low intensity cardio. A good way to start would be to walk on the treadmill for 5-10 min before starting to pump iron.

                        Personally I try to ride my bike to the gym to warm up, it is both relaxing and a relatively low level of cardio which gets me moving before getting ready to start lifting.
