        NOTE: The head and body can be indented at the same level as the html root, so you can save some horizontal real estate.
        Also, be sure that you review your code throughout, as it needs revision with regards to representing the hierarchical relationships.

        No header/banner or nav for the page

        I notice that you're using header more than you should be, based on your structure. Consider the following:

        CURRENT STRUCTURE
        main
            - header > h1
            - img
            - p*2
            - header > h1
            - img
            - p*2
            - aside
                - header > h1
                - p*2
            - header > h1
            - p
            - ul > li
            - ul > li
            - ul > li

        ONE SUGGESTED STRUCTURE STARTING WITHIN THE <body>
        There are lots of combinations to consider, but you will need to revise with more semantically appropriate tags and structure.

        header > h1 (for the page with an h1 which is reserved for the title of the page)
        main
            /*
                Repeat this structure below for those units of content about particular topics regarding "Swolenomics 101"
                Are these meant to be like introductory cards, where people can navigate to a dedicated page about that topic? If so, consider content that calls the audience to action to click on a provided link to that page, which I will add in the suggestion below.
            */
            - section
                - header > h2
                - div > img
                - div
                    - paragraphs/textual content
                    - CTA <a>

                <!--
                    I like the idea here, but you definitely want to semantically define these as a cohesive unit of the FAQ. Consider the following, which will tell screenreaders that there is an unordered list, which you can define as a region BTW with a label:

                    ul (container for all FAQs)
                        - li (Q/A pair)
                            - p (for Question)
                            - p (for Answer)
                        - rinse and repeat that li structure

                    Also, I would suggest creating a separate page for this content. These can get long and not everyone will use it as a priority, so you can just keep it handy in your navigation menu.
