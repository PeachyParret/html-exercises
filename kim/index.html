                Going to the gym is for EVERYONE, no matter age, gender, and ability. Weightlifting can have amazing health benefits for all. Do not be detered from the gym because you feel you will get too bulky, "toning" is actully a different way of saying reducing body fat AND replacing it with muscle mass!

            <p> 
                Warming up is arguably just as important as the actual workout. If you were to just jump straight into a hard excersise, at best you will not perform well, at worse you can seriously injure yourself leading to weeks of recovery and physical therapy. No one wants that! 
            </p>
            <p>
                Warming up is anything that gets your muscles moving and blood pumping. This could range from performing a set of the excersize you are about to do with very light weight or low intensity cardio. A good way to start would be to walk on the treadmill for 5-10 min before starting to pump iron.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Personally I try to ride my bike to the gym to warm up, it is both relaxing and a relatively low level of cardio which gets me moving before getting ready to start lifting.
            </p>
            <P> 
                After you have warmed up learn how to perform the core 3 excersizes that will get you started working out! <a href="form.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
