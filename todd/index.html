        <p>To get started making jewelry you'll need a few basic supplies. Firstly, you'll want to invest in jewelry making pliers. There are several different types that you can usually buy in sets. You’ll want flat nose, wide flat nose, chain nose, bent chain nose, round nose, and wire cutters. Additionally, you should pick out some beads you like. Bead type isn’t important for basic jewelry, but if you’re wanting to make more intricate pieces look into our sources for what kind of beads you’ll need for those projects. Lastly, you’ll want to buy some findings, chains, string, and wires. Findings are things like clasps, jump rings, link connectors, headpins and eye pins, and crimps.</p>

                <p>Though it is easy to be too ambitious, it is better to start with simple pieces, so you don't feel discouraged. The beginning of your journey is tough, so build your confidence here before moving on to harder projects. A good first project is a chain bracelet or necklace with bead charms. </p>
