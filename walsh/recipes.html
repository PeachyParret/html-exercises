                    Chicken Stir Fry
                </h4>
                    <p>
                        This recipe is a great one to check out! There are multiple variations that I like to do to this. One thing that I do to make it faster is buying frozen vegetables. All you need is chicken breast, Minute Rice, vegetables, and a sauce of your choice. Sometimes I get a bag of frozen chicken strips (healhty ones) to use so I don't need to cook chicken breasts.

                    Chicken Salad
                </h4>
                    <p>
                        All you need for this recipe are fresh vegetables, salad, chicken, and a dressing of your choice. I like to add rice and hummus into my salad as well to add a little extra flavor!

                    Spaghetti Squash
                </h4>
                 <p>
                    This one takes a little bit longer than 30 minutes, but all you need is a spaghetti squash, marinara sauce, and meatballs if you would like to add protein. This recipe is super healthy and tastes very yummy.
