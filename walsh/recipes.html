                Chicken Stir Fry
            </h3>
                <p>
                    This recipe is a great one to check out! There are multiple variations that I like to do to this. One thing that I do to make it faster is buying frozen vegetables. All you need is chicken breast, Minute Rice, vegetables, and a sauce of your choice. Sometimes I get a bag of frozen chicken strips (healhty ones) to use so I don't need to cook chicken breasts.

            <h3>
                Chicken Salad
            </h3>
                <p>
                    All you need for this recipe are fresh vegetables, salad, chicken, and a dressing of your choice. I like to add rice and hummus into my salad as well to add a little extra flavor!

                Spaghetti Squash
            </h3>
                <p>
                This one takes a little bit longer than 30 minutes, but all you need is a spaghetti squash, marinara sauce, and meatballs if you would like to add protein. This recipe is super healthy and tastes very yummy.
