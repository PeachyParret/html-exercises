                        This recipe is a great one to check out! There are multiple variations that I like to do to this. One thing that I do to make it faster is buying frozen vegetables. All you need is chicken breast, Minute Rice, vegetables, and a sauce of your choice. Sometimes I get a bag of frozen chicken strips (healhty ones) to use so I don't need to cook chicken breasts.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Prepare the chicken in whatever way you prefer  
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Cook the frozen vegetables and rice at the same time
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            All three foods should be done at the same time and enjoy!

                        All you need for this recipe are fresh vegetables, salad, chicken, and a dressing of your choice. I like to add rice and hummus into my salad as well to add a little extra flavor!

                        This recipe is very versitaile. I like to make a lot of it and eat it with several different sides throughout the week. Try putting it on salads, in a tortilla, or plain with a side of vegetables.
