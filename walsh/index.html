        Any reason this figure is all by itself? Is it linked to the header? Is it an intro to the main content? Consider the relationships, which you define via your HTML structure.

        If it's for introducing your main content, then consider wrapping that content in another header as the first child of main to look like this:

                Whether you are an incoming freshman or a fifth year senior, here are some helpful hints that can make your college experience a little bit more enjoyable:

                    - I'd close the paragraph, then start the ul>li content as it's own unit that is a sibling of the other paragraphs in this content area.
                    - Are these going to be card-like pieces on your page with CTAs? Like a link to a page dedicated to that tip? If so, consider the following suggested revision to the strcuture:

                    ul (card container)
                        - li (card pattern)
                            - figure (image content)
                            - div (to wrap textual content)
                                - h3 (instead of just an inline strong element)
                                - p (instead of the ul>li that isn't quite appropriate for this use context)
                                - a (add this as a CTA+link to guide users to another page)
                        - rinse and repeat the li pattern above for each "card"

                                        Sometimes a treat to reward yourself for your hard work and stress can go a long way, however, always eating junk food can make you feel gross and unhappy. Find the balance that works for you.

                                    Try not to nap or watch TV during the hours of 9 am and 5 pm. If you use that time wisely, you can avoid staying up late to finish assignments and can spend the evening hours with friends or being a part of clubs.

                                    This one sounds cliche, but it's so true! It doesn't need to be anything related to your future career, in fact, it might be better to get involved with something else to help ease stress and burnout.
