                    It is very important to eat a balanced diet, however, sometimes a treat to reward yourself for your hard work and stress can go a long way, however, always eating junk food can make you feel gross and unhappy. Find the balance that works for you.

                    Try not to nap or watch TV during the hours of 9 am and 5 pm. If you use that time wisely, you can avoid staying up late to finish assignments and can spend the evening hours with friends or being a part of clubs.

                    This one sounds cliche, but it's so true! It doesn't need to be anything related to your future career, in fact, it might be better to get involved with something else to help ease stress and burnout.

                    It is very important for you to recognize when you need extra support. Colleges have therapists and programs for a reason. Don't feel bad for reaching out and getting that extra help.
