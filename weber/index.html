                  <p>Blacksburg has a long list of iconic restaurants that every visitor should check out if given the opportunity. However, some are more budget-friendly than others. If you feel like going out, or just don't want to cook, check out these popular stops that are a little easier on the wallet:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Green's Grill and Sushi Bar: If you're trying to go out with a group of people that can't agree on one kind of food, Green's is a great place to go. Green's is popular for sushi, but it also serves Mediterranean food, tacos, vegetarian fare, and more. </li>
                      <li>Mellow Mushroom: Mellow Mushroom isn't a Blacksburg-exclusive restaurant, but it can often be cheaper than going to a chain pizza place (depending on what you get, of course).</li>
                      <li>Chinese Kitchen: Not necessarily a restaurant, but if you're in the mood for Chinese takeout, this is a great spot. I'm personally a fan of the crabmeat fried rice :)</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

            <p>Housing in Blacksburg is getting pretty close to an oxymoron. Still, there's some relatively inexpensive options out there for you. Something to keep in mind is that the further away from Blacksburg you get, the cheaper it is, but that might translate to higher transportation costs if it means you need to drive to get to campus. Check out some of these apartment complexes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Shawnee</li>
              <li>Chasewood Downs</li>
              <li>The Mill</li>
            </ul>
          <p>This is clearly not a comprehensive list, but my general advice is to look as far away from campus as you can, but opt for a place that has bus stops nearby. This ensures that you aren't paying for proximity, but you can still get to where you need to go easily.</p>

            <p>Transportation in Blacksburg is by no means perfect, but there's definitely some options to work with:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Blacksburg Transit is by and large what most of the population uses to get around Virginia Tech's campus and its neighboring housing areas. It's free, and bus stops are located throughout Blacksburg. The Blacksburg Transit app allows you to see where the buses are in real time, and view the schedules for each bus.</li>
              <li>If you don't own a car and you're looking to get out of town, there's a couple Virginia Tech carpooling Facebook groups that might be able to help you out. That said, be prepared to chip in for gas.</li>

          <p>One convenient aspect about Blacksburg is that it has a plethora of ways to have an inexpensive, fun time. Check out the following:</p>
          <ul>

            <li>Nextthreedays: Nextthreedays is essentially the New River Valley equivalent of Gobblerconnect, except it's focused on, as it says in the name, events in the next three days.</li>
            <li>The Lyric Theatre: The Lyric offers a free showing of a particular film each Friday. Show times may vary. </li>
            <li>The Blacksburg Farmers Market: The Blacksburg Farmers Market often features live music and plenty of dogs to fawn over.
