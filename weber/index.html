                  <p>Blacksburg has a long list of iconic restaurants that every visitor should check out if given the opportunity. However, some are more budget-friendly than others. If you feel like going out, or just don't want to cook, check out these popular stops that are a little easier on the wallet:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Green's Grill and Sushi Bar: If you're trying to go out with a group of people that can't agree on one kind of food, Green's is a great place to go. Green's is popular for sushi, but it also serves Mediterranean food, tacos, vegetarian fare, and more. </li>
                      <li>Mellow Mushroom: Mellow Mushroom isn't a Blacksburg-exclusive restaurant, but it can often be cheaper than going to a chain pizza place (depending on what you get, of course).</li>
                    </ul>

            <p>Housing in Blacksburg is getting pretty close to an oxymoron. Still, there's some relatively inexpensive options out there for you. Something to keep in mind is that the further away from Blacksburg you get, the cheaper it is, but that might translate to higher transportation costs if it means you need to drive to get to campus.</p>

            <p>Transportation in Blacksburg is by no means perfect, but there's definitely some options to work with. Blacksburg Transit is by and large what most of the population uses to get around campus and its neighboring housing areas. However, if you're looking to get further than that, you'll likely need to own a car, or know someone who does. If you aren't inclined to purchase an entire vehicle, there's a couple Virginia Tech carpooling Facebook groups, and you can always poke around on the Virginia Tech Reddit thread to see if anyone can help you out. That said, be prepared to chip in for gas.</p>

          <p>It can be hard to figure out where to start if you want information on financial resources, but I've compiled some that I and people I know personally have found helpful. </p>
