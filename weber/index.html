                <h3>Food</h3>
                <p>One of the perks of Blacksburg is that because it's quite rural, there's a few more cheap food options than say, closer to Roanoke. Check out the following places for a solid meal:</p>

            <h3>Housing</h3>
            <p>Housing in Blacksburg is getting pretty close to an oxymoron. Still, there's some relatively inexpensive options out there for you. Something to keep in mind is that the further away from Blacksburg you get, the cheaper it is, but that might translate to higher transportation costs if it means you need to drive to get to campus.</p>

            <h3>Transportation</h3>
            <!-- aria-labelledby isn't an element; it's an attribute to place in the opening tag of the landmark element -->
            <p>Transportation in Blacksburg is by no means perfect, but there's definitely some options to wor with. Blacksburg Transit is by and large what most of the population uses to get around campus and its neighboring housing areas. However, if you're looking to get further than that, you'll likely need to own a car, or know someone who does. If you aren't inclined to purchase an entire vehicle, there's a couple Virginia Tech carpooling Facebook groups, and you can always poke around on the Virginia Tech Reddit thread to see if anyone can help you out. That said, be prepared to chip in for gas.</p>
