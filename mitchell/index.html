                Interested in reading as much as you used to a kid but not finding the time or the money to constantly purchase new books online or venture out to a library or bookstore? Wishing that you could try new books without paying 15 dollars just to find you hate it on chapter three? Finding your friends' or bookclub's recommendations are not hitting home?
            </p>
            <p>Well, then I have a solution to your troubles: The Web Serial!</p>
        </section>

            <h2 id="define-serial">Defining Web Serial</h2>
            <p>
                Web serials are ongoing stories that release new content in chapters rather than books on a set schedule. That schedule could be monthly, weekly or even daily depending on chapter lengths and the speed of the authors, but what it means is that the internet has a vast amount of new original content for people to enjoy. Not only are serials the most accessible form of publishing available to hopeful writers, they also provide quick and easy reading for readers who are willing to accept less editing polish in exchange for free content.

            <h2 id="maj-website">Major Websites</h2>
            <p>
                Much like a library, there are online spaces that host collections of stories. A search function, tags, genres, recommendations list, and leaderboards of popular and highly rated serials will help you navigate the site.
