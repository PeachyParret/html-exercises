            So far a simple pattern below. Needs attention to some issues:
            - Will this page include much of the content in those sections, or will there be dedicated pages and these are CTAs for those pages? That will dictate what elements you might consider using instead of section here on the home page.
            - Need roles and labels throughout.
            - footer? aside?
            - all attributes should be lowercase
            - "id" attributes should be lowercase and never have whitespaces. Use hyphens between words, e.g., "Getting Started" can be "getting-started"
            - Need some images with src, alt, width, height, srcset
