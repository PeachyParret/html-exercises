                        <strong>Age: 3 | Height: 4'4" | Weight: 82lb</strong><br> <br>Jack-Jack is the epitome of a quarantine puppy. He is playful and gentle, but definitely prefers having all of us together. His only fears are the dark and small children. He is equal-ish parts Black Lab, German Shepherd, Pit Bull, and mutt. He was fostered by our close friends in 2020 and has been in our family ever since. His favorite color is red.

                    <strong>Age: 11 | Height: 2'3" | Weight: 18lb</strong><br> <br>Dash's littermate. She has won medals in being lazy, but didn't feel like getting up to retrieve them. Thinks she rules the world (and does). She has a very sensitive stomach, so she has to have her own special food. She also has a broken meow, which is completely tragic (but totally harmless). But she doesn't let that stop her from squeaking at the top of her little lungs at four in the morning!

                        <strong>Age: 11 | Height: 2'5" | Weight: 12lb</strong> <br> <br>Violet's littermate. Our most mischevious pet by far. His favorite pastimes include knocking cups off of tables and making a mess with his water bowl. You can usually find him in the corner of whatever room you're in, pretending to not enjoy spending time with you. Complimentary to his name, he can run very fast. His favorite color is white, so he can get his black fur all over it.

He is very inquisitive and playful, which can get him in trouble. He is a master escape artist, inexplicably escaping out of any room he is put in. We all fear the day he discovers how to get outside. Until then, we're happy to let him wiggle wherever he wants.
