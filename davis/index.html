          The <p> and img> are both siblings of the h2, which are all children of the section. So, those siblings should all be indented the same.
          While some folks like to indent based on the implicit structure, I recommend not doing so. It helps to reserve your indentations for actual parent-child relationships, due to spacing in your editor's window.
