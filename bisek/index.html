    Summative Feedback
    - I know much more about Stardew Valley! :-)
    - Note the revised indentation work with the doctype, head, and body
    - Some a11y issues to resolve throughout.
        1. See my two screenshots from VoiceOver. Note how the landmarks aren't defined with labels and indicates 2 mains are being used, since you've defined a section with the role of main
        2. Lots of h3 headings. I see why you use them, and you can totally keep them, as I think there's a case for their use. But, I also want you to consider if those h3s clutter up the screenreading experience. In other words, is there sufficient amount of content to warrant the repeated use of h3 elemeents for shorter imperative tips? I'm not sure, and I wonder if there's any UX research about this matter.
    - Big one to note: Over use of section and when it is used, you only put the heading inside of it. All of the content that is part of a coheisve section should be contained by that section. Otherwise, that strucutre isn't meaningful, since it doesn't contain the content intended to be in the section.

            Hello new farmers! Welcome to the ultimate beginnerâ€™s guide to Stardew Valley. This site contains everything players need to know in order to cultivate a successful farm during their first year in Pelican Town. Every player is different which means every farm will be different, so this site covers the root basics of farming, foraging, fishing, mining and combat. Everything covered on this site will be limited to what can be done and collected during the first year. For more experienced players, find a complete Stardew Valley wiki down below. Happy playing!

                        Crafting grass requires a lot of fiber, fiber much needed for other means of crafting. You can buy grass from Pierre, but it is expensive early on. If you do not have grass for your animals, they cannot eat and you have buy hay. Cut grass as needed. Trees take a lot of time to grow back. Wood is easy to collect, so don't go crazy and leave yourself with no wood for days.

                    <p>
                        The Prismatic Shard is one of the rarest and most valuable collectables in the game. While most players don't acquire one until further on in the game, it is possible to come across one while foraging, hoeing the worms in the ground, fishing, and early game mining (all slim chances). Do not donate it to Gunther and do not sell it. Keep it for when you can access the Calico Desert in order to get the Galaxy Sword.

                    <p>
                        Another rare item that normally isn't obtained early in the game, Dinosaur Eggs can be obtained in the same way Prismatic Shards are (again slim chance) early in the game. Do not donate or sell it, instead keep it for when you have a good enough coop to incubate it. It will eventually hatch and you will have unlimited Dinosaurs and Dinosaur Eggs. The eggs are very valuable and a good way to make quick money.

                    <p>
                        This item is similar to the Dino Egg. Obtained later in the game, you still have a slim chance of finding one. Save it to eventually craft and incubator and have unlimited Ostrich eggs. One egg produces 10 jars of mayo which is a wicked profit.

                    <p>
                        While selling wood, stone, fiber and hardwood may seem like an easy way to make money, all are vital in crafting and constructing on your farm. Crafting machines and useful tools are essential to a positive gameplay experience. Constructing buildings require alot of material which can be timely in collecting.

                    <h3>All ore</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Similar to raw materials, ore is useful most in upgrading tools. While it is often used it crafting as well, upgrading tools is a quick way to make farm life more efficent. Clint will eventually ask you to craft a furnace which you can use to smelt bars. They are used for upgrading and crafting. Collecting ore will become easier, but keep it handy at first.

                    <p>
                        Technically, no. Completeing the Community Center unlocks hidden or broken places/elements in the game. However, buying a Joja Mart membership does the same thing for a price of coins. The villagers don't believe in this ethically, and Pierre will go out of business, but in the end it is your choice to make.

                    <p>
                        Nothing game ending will happen. However, certain items take a lot of luck and time to collect. You will be able to obtain everything in the game again eventually, it'll just take you more time. Don't sweat it too much, though. Everyone goes at a different pace depending on how they like to facilitate their farm.

                    <h3>Why is my farm not as far along as others during the same year?</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Like I was saying before, every farm is different and every farm has a different timeline. Some players play at a faster rate, some slow, but there are also luck elements in the game that can differ player to player. Just now that with enough time and work, your farm will get to the place you want it to be eventually.
