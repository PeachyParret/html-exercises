        Some high-level items:
        - all filenames should adhere to the conventions noted in class: all lowercase, no whitespaces but use hyphens, etc.

        Really, really, really take the time to focus on your HTML work right now, as there are numerous items to revise:
            - Avoid most styling tags, like <center>, which is deprecated anyways. We will learn how to style them with CSS very very soon. These tags can make it difficult for you later. Definitely remove the center tag. Most of the em and strong are fine though.
            - Same comment with regards to inline CSS styles. You will need to remove them evenetually, and we will discuss why inlines styles are to be typically avoided.
            - Spot all of the red or off-colored tags, which indicate an error. Some element isn't closed, so it's breaking your relationships. Many of the section opening tags do not include the ">"
            - I noticed that you may have copy-pasted code from my demo. That is ok to a degree. Many of the revisions noted here are due to dropping in some code without knowing what is doing or if it should even be there: abbr tags, lots of redundancies like doubling up on the h2 tags, etc.
            - Indentation needs lots of attention throughout. Needs to be more consistent and rep the hierarchical relationships.
            - Remove all of the white spaces when you open and close tags, such as "<h2> <strong> Welcome to Pelican Town! </strong> </h2>" In this case, the strong isn't necessary either, as it's something you can apply with CSS, so you need not repeat yourself everywhere in your HTML, so I'd just write it as <h2>Welcome to Pelican Town!</h2>

            The identation is incorrect here and there is unwrapped content, such as "Mayor Lewis gifts ..." I see how you were thinking an ul here. It works, and you can definitely run with it, but all content should be wrapped.
            Also, since there is content per "do", you could use a <div> with an h3 per suggestion, like so:

            - div
                - h3
                - p
            - rinse and repeat
        -->
        <ul>
            <li> <strong> Plant seeds immediately!! </strong>  </li> 
            Mayor Lewis gifts you 15 parsnips seeds your first day. Using your hoe and watering can, plant them as soon as you walk outside. When you get more money, immediately go buy more seeds at Pierre's.
                
                   
                <li> <strong>Check and open your mailbox every morning</strong> </li>
                     Villagers send you useful information, gifts and even money. Make sure to look for the mail icon above the mailbox every morning. 
                        
            
                        <li> <strong>Meet and befriend every villager</strong> </li>
                            Villagers often gift you useful resources if you have a high relationship. Make sure to gift and talk to villagers daily. You can also romance and marry single villagers.
            
                            <li> <strong>Complete the Community Center ASAP!</strong> </li>
                              During the first few days. Mayor Lewis will tell you about the abandoned community center. Make sure to complete bundles to unlock it as soon as you can. It fixes broken items around the village and boosts friendships.
           
                                 <li> <strong>Don't be afraid to spend your money early in the game</strong> </li>
                                    The more seeds and livestock you buy, the more money will get. Don't get so hungup on saving when you can earned four times more.
           
                                     <li> <strong>Level up your skills quickly</strong> </li>
                                        If you have spare time in the day, use your remaining energy to level up skills. Tasks become easier and you gain helpful perks.
                                        
                                        <li> <strong>Begin to organize chests early on</strong>  </li>
                                            Color-coding chests is a good way to make gameplay easier and limit wasted time.
                                            
                                            <li> <strong>MINE, MINE, MINE!</strong> </li>
                                                Though it can seem intimidating, mining is a great way to progress the game and acquire needed materialas for tool upgrades. Winter is a good time to mine constantly.

                                                <li> <strong>Upgrade tools ASAP (but only certain ones)</strong> </li>
                                                    Your pickaxe, axe, watering can and hoe are vital to upgrade as soon as possible. It makes tasks much easier and saves you a lot of energy. Be aware that it takes one or multiple days for your tool to be done.
