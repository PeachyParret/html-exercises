            <li> <strong> Plant seeds immediately!! </strong>  </li> 
            Mayor Lewis gifts you 15 parsnips seeds your first day. Using your hoe and watering can, plant them as soon as you walk outside. When you get more money, immediately go buy more seeds at Pierre's.
                
                   
                <li> <strong>Check and open your mailbox every morning</strong> </li>
                     Villagers send you useful information, gifts and even money. Make sure to look for the mail icon above the mailbox every morning. 
                        
            
                        <li> <strong>Meet and befriend every villager</strong> </li>
                            Villagers often gift you useful resources if you have a high relationship. Make sure to gift and talk to villagers daily. You can also romance and marry single villagers.
            
                            <li> <strong>Complete the Community Center ASAP!</strong> </li>
                              During the first few days. Mayor Lewis will tell you about the abandoned community center. Make sure to complete bundles to unlock it as soon as you can. It fixes broken items around the village and boosts friendships.
           
                                 <li> <strong>Don't be afraid to spend your money early in the game</strong> </li>
                                    The more seeds and livestock you buy, the more money will get. Don't get so hungup on saving when you can earned four times more.
           
                                     <li> <strong>Level up your skills quickly</strong> </li>
                                        If you have spare time in the day, use your remaining energy to level up skills. Tasks become easier and you gain helpful perks.
                                        
                                        <li> <strong>Begin to organize chests early on</strong>  </li>

                                            <li> <strong>MINE, MINE, MINE!</strong> </li>
                                                Though it can seem intimidating, mining is a great way to progress the game and acquire needed materialas for tool upgrades. Winter is a good time to mine constantly.

                                                <li> <strong>Upgrade tools ASAP (but only certain ones)</strong> </li>

            <li> <strong>Do not sell everything right away!</strong> </li>
            Having one of everything (foragables, crops, ore, etc.) is a good way to stay on top of the community center and any other requests from villagers.
                
                <li> <strong>Do not forget to water your crops</strong> </li>
                Missing even one day of watering can hold your plant back one day of growing. This can really hurt you come the end of the season.
            
                    
                    <li> <strong>Do not plant your plants at the end of the season (or when you don't have enough days left in the season for that specific crop) </strong> </li>
                    Every plant has a growth time. Make sure you take not of how long each plant takes to grow and plan accordingly.
            
                        
                        <li> <strong> Do not cut all your grass or chop down all trees at one time</strong> </li>
                        Crafting grass requires a lot of fiber, fiber much needed for other means of crafting. You can buy grass from Pierre, but it is expensive early on. If you do not have grass for your animals, they cannot eat and you have buy hay. Cut grass as needed. Trees take a lot of time to grow back. Wood is easy to collect, so don't go crazy and leave yourself with no wood for days.
