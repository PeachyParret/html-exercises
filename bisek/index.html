                        Though it can seem intimidating, mining is a great way to progress the game and acquire needed materials for tool upgrades. Winter is a good time to mine constantly.

        <ul>
            <li>Do not sell everything right away!</li>
            Having one of everything (foragables, crops, ore, etc.) is a good way to stay on top of the community center and any other requests from villagers.
                
                <li>Do not forget to water your crops</li>
                Missing even one day of watering can hold your plant back one day of growing. This can really hurt you come the end of the season.
            
                    
                    <li>Do not plant your plants at the end of the season (or when you don't have enough days left in the season for that specific crop)</li>
                    Every plant has a growth time. Make sure you take not of how long each plant takes to grow and plan accordingly.
            
                        
                        <li>Do not cut all your grass or chop down all trees at one time</li>
                        Crafting grass requires a lot of fiber, fiber much needed for other means of crafting. You can buy grass from Pierre, but it is expensive early on. If you do not have grass for your animals, they cannot eat and you have buy hay. Cut grass as needed. Trees take a lot of time to grow back. Wood is easy to collect, so don't go crazy and leave yourself with no wood for days.

            
                            <li>Do no put off the community center</li>
                            Keep in mind items you need for the community center. Don't think you can just wait to do it, unless you plan on buying th Joja Mart membership ...traitor.
            
                                
                                <li>Do not go into the mine unprepared</li>
                                Make sure whenever you make a trip to the mine, you have the necessary tools, food, and health tonics to stay alive and swift.
