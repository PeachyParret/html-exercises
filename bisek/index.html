            Hello new farmers! Welcome to the ultimate beginnerâ€™s guide to Stardew Valley. This site contains everything players need to know in order to cultivate a successful farm during their first year in Pelican Town. Every player is different which means every farm will be different, so this site covers the root basics of farming, foraging, fishing, mining and combat. Everything covered on this site will be limited to what can be done and collected during the first year. For more experienced players, find a complete Stardew Valley wiki down below. Happy playing!

                    <h3>Plant seeds immediately</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Mayor Lewis gifts you 15 parsnips seeds your first day. Using your hoe and watering can, plant them as soon as you walk outside. When you get more money, immediately go buy more seeds at Pierre's.
                    </p>
            </li> 
            <li>
                    <h3>Check and open your mailbox every morning</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Villagers send you useful information, gifts and even money. Make sure to look for the mail icon above the mailbox every morning.
                    </p>

            <li>
                        <h3>Meet and befriend every villager</h3> 
                        <p>
                            Villagers often gift you useful resources if you have a high relationship. Make sure to gve gifts and talk to villagers daily. You can also romance and marry single villagers.

                    <p>
                        During the first few days. Mayor Lewis will tell you about the abandoned community center. Make sure to complete bundles to unlock it as soon as you can. It fixes broken items around the village and boosts friendships.

                    <h3>Don't be afraid to spend your money early</h3> 
                    <p>
                        The more seeds and livestock you buy, the more money will get. Don't get so hungup on saving when you can earn four times more.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you have spare time in the day, use your remaining energy to level up skills. Tasks become easier and you gain helpful perks.

            </li>
            <li>
                    <h3>Begin to organize chests early on in the game</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Color-coding chests is a good way to make gameplay easier and limit wasted time.

            <li>
                    <h3>MINE!MINE!MINE!</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Though it can seem intimidating, mining is a great way to progress the game and acquire needed materials for tool upgrades. Winter is a good time to mine constantly.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                    <h3>Upgrade your tools ASAP (but only certain ones)</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Your pickaxe, axe, watering can and hoe are vital to upgrade as soon as possible. It makes tasks much easier and saves you a lot of energy. Be aware that it takes one or multiple days for your tool to be done.

        </h2>
        <ol class="the-donts-list">
            <li>
                    <h3>Do not sell everything right away!</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Having one of everything (foragables, crops, ore, etc.) is a good way to stay on top of the community center and any other requests from villagers.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                    <h3>Do not forget to water your crops every morning</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Missing even one day of watering can hold your plant back one day of growing. This can really hurt you come the end of the season.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                    <h3>Do not plant your crops at the end of the season (or when you don't have enough days left in the season for that specific crop)</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Every plant has a growth time. Make sure you take note of how long each plant takes to grow and plan accordingly.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                    <h3>Do not cut all your grass or chop down all trees at one time</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Crafting grass requires a lot of fiber, fiber much needed for other means of crafting. You can buy grass from Pierre, but it is expensive early on. If you do not have grass for your animals, they cannot eat and you have to buy hay. Cut grass as needed. Trees take a lot of time to grow back. Wood is easy to collect, so don't go crazy and leave yourself with no wood for days.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                    <h3>Do not put off completeing the Community Center</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Keep in mind items you need for the community center. Don't think you can just wait to do it, unless you plan on buying th Joja Mart membership ...traitor.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                    <h3>Do not go into the mine unprepared</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Make sure whenever you make a trip to the mine, you have the necessary tools, food, and health tonics to stay alive and swift.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                    <h3>Do not forget to love and feed your animals everyday</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Your livestock need affection and grass/hay everyday to produce collectables. Remembering to do both results in more profitable and bigger collectables. Forgetting can result in none.

            Items to Keep
        </h2>
        <ol class="items-list">
            <li>
                    <h3>Prismatic Shard</h3> 
                    <p>
                        The Prismatic Shard is one of the rarest and most valuable collectables in the game. While most players don't acquire one until further on in the game, it is possible to come across one while foraging, hoeing the worms in the ground, fishing, and early game mining (all slim chances). Do not donate it to Gunther and do not sell it. Keep it for when you can access the Calico Desert in order to get the Galaxy Sword.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                    <h3>Dinosaur Egg</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Another rare item that normally isn't obtained early in the game, Dinosaur Eggs can be obtained in the same way Prismatic Shards are (again slim chance) early in the game. Do not donate or sell it, instead keep it for when you have a good enough coop to incubate it. It will eventually hatch and you will have unlimited Dinosaurs and Dinosaur Eggs. The eggs are very valuable and a good way to make quick money.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                    <h3>Ostrich Egg</h3> 
                    <p>
                        This item is similar to the Dino Egg. Obtained later in the game, you still have a slim chance of finding one. Save it to eventually craft an incubator and have unlimited Ostrich eggs. One egg produces 10 jars of mayo which is a wicked profit.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                    <h3>All raw materials</h3> 
                    <p>
                        While selling wood, stone, fiber and hardwood may seem like an easy way to make money, all are vital in crafting and constructing on your farm. Crafting machines and useful tools are essential to a positive gameplay experience. Constructing buildings require alot of material which can be timely in collecting. 
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                    <h3>All ore</h3> 
                    <p>
                        Similar to raw materials, ore is useful most in upgrading tools. While it is often used it crafting as well, upgrading tools is a quick way to make farm life more efficent. Clint will eventually ask you to craft a furnace which you can use to smelt bars. They are used for upgrading and crafting. Collecting ore will become easier, but keep it handy at first. 
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                    <h3>Community Center items</h3> 
                    <p>
                        If you are completing the Community Center, make sure to take note of what is required. Some items can only be obtained during certains seasons and weather. If you get ahold of any fish, crop, ore, etc. make sure to check if you need it for a bundle. Some items you may have to wait an entire year to be able to get again.
