            Bread is the first thing everybody thinks about when having a GF diet. There really isn't anything that will compare to regular whitebread. GF bread is drier, crumblier, and more expensive, so don't expect to be relying on the sandwich bread to be the best part of the sandwich. In my 8 years of experience, it is the thing I miss most, but there are a lot of solid options out there for you. 
            Lots of large grocery stores have gluten free bread options, and my top two are <a href="https://canyonglutenfree.com/" target="_blank">Canyonhouse</a> and <a href="https://shop.schar.com/" target="blank">Schar</a>; however, <a href="https://www.udisglutenfree.com/" target="_blank">Udi's</a> has been around for a while and they've been improving. In terms of sandwich shops, Jersey Mike's and Firehouse use Udi's and Schar respectively, and they both have processess in place to reduce as much cross-contamination as they can. <em>No restaurant will be able to reduce all gluten.</em> Make sure, no matter what restaurant that you go to, that you tell them that you have a GF allergy.
            Now, you may be thinking that making your own bread may be a great alternative. I want to encourage anybody to try making their own bread at least once, just to understand the challenges of using GF flour and understanding its limitations.

            Gluten Free pasta is made from alternative flours like rice, corn, quinoa, or chickpea. These flours give each type of gluten-free pasta its unique flavor and texture. First up, rice flour pasta. It's the mild-mannered hero of gluten-free pasta, not too flashy but super versatile. It plays well with a variety of sauces, making it the go-to choice for many gluten-free pasta enthusiasts. Then there's quinoa pasta, bringing a nutty flavor to the table. Quinoa is not only delicious but also packs a protein punch, making it a nutritious option for those looking to up their protein game. And let's not forget chickpea pasta, the protein powerhouse. If you're into heartier meals, this one's for you. It's got that satisfying chewiness and is an excellent canvas for your favorite sauces and toppings. Barilla makes a very good high-protein gluten free pasta that is good if you want to avoid a lot of carbs. Now, cooking gluten-free pasta can be a bit of an art. It tends to get a bit mushy if you're not careful. But fear not! Manufacturers usually have specific cooking instructions on the package, and a little experimentation in the kitchen can go a long way. Some folks swear by rinsing the pasta under cold water right after cooking to prevent the dreaded sticky situation. The gluten-free pasta industry has come a long way from where kt started. It used to be a bit tricky to find one that didn't turn into a mushy mess, but nowadays, you can enjoy a plate of gluten-free goodness without sacrificing flavor or texture.

            When it comes to meat itself, the good news is that fresh, unprocessed meat, like chicken, beef, pork, fish, etc., is naturally gluten-free. However, it's crucial to be aware of potential pitfalls in the form of marinades and condiments. Marinades are a fantastic way to infuse flavor into your meat, but they can be sneaky sources of gluten. Many store-bought marinades contain soy sauce, which often contains wheat. To stay on the safe side, opt for gluten-free soy sauce or tamari when marinating your meats. Better yet, explore alternative marinades using herbs, spices, and gluten-free condiments to add a burst of flavor without the gluten risk. Condiments, those beloved flavor enhancers, can be a double-edged sword for gluten-free meat lovers. Traditional sauces like barbecue sauce, teriyaki sauce, and certain gravies may contain gluten. Fear not, the gluten-free market has expanded significantly, and you can easily find gluten-free versions of these condiments at your local grocery store. Check labels carefully, as manufacturers often indicate whether their products are gluten-free. It's not just about store-bought condiments, though. If you're dining out or enjoying a meal at someone else's home, communication is key. Ask about the ingredients in sauces or dressings to ensure they're gluten-free. Cross-contamination can occur when shared utensils, cutting boards, or cooking surfaces come into contact with gluten-containing ingredients. So, when grilling or cooking at home, designate specific tools for gluten-free preparations to prevent any inadvertent gluten exposure. If you're a fan of processed meats like sausages, hot dogs, or deli meats, be extra cautious. These products can sometimes be processed with ingredients that contain gluten or be cross-contaminated during manufacturing. Opt for brands that clearly label their products as gluten-free, and when in doubt, contact the manufacturer for clarification.

              Starting with the basics, eggs are a fantastic gluten-free breakfast option. Scrambled, fried, poached, etc. Eggs are a versatile and naturally gluten-free choice. Moving on to everyone's breakfast favorite: cereal. Gluten-free cereal options have significantly expanded, offering everything from rice puffs to corn flakes. It's crucial to read labels carefully, as some cereals may still contain gluten. Additionally, consider the potential for cross-contamination in shared processing facilities. To ensure safety, choose brands explicitly labeled as gluten-free.Toast lovers need not despair, gluten-free bread has become increasingly accessible. However, just like with cereals, cross-contamination can be a concern. To mitigate the risk, use a dedicated toaster for gluten-free bread or employ toaster bags to avoid direct contact with gluten remnants. As mentioned before, breakfast meats, such as sausages and bacon, can sometimes harbor gluten in the form of seasonings or additives. When buying these products, opt for those explicitly labeled as gluten-free. As always, avoid cross-contamination by using separate utensils and cooking surfaces for gluten-free and gluten-containing items. The allure of pastries and muffins may still beckon, but traditional wheat-based options are off-limits, but of course, there are GF alternatives. Try your hand at homemade gluten-free muffins or pancakes using gluten-free flour. Homemade is usually always better for tehse because a lot of prepackaged mixes contain something that gums up in your mouth. If you eat too fast, like me, it'll get clogged up in your esophaguas which is pretty uncomfortable and probably dangerous. When dining out, many restaurants now offer gluten-free menus or options, but it's crucial to inform your server about your dietary needs. Cross-contamination can occur in shared cooking spaces, so kindly request separate utensils or grilling areas to ensure a gluten-free meal.

              Many delectable desserts cater to gluten-free needs, but beware of hidden gluten. Use gluten-free flours when baking at home, making sure your treats are safe and scrumptious. When indulging in store-bought goodies, check the labels for gluten-free certification to sidestep any accidental gluten encounters. Cookies, brownies, and cakes now come in delightful gluten-free versions, offering a delicious escape from wheat-based desserts. However, cross-contamination remains a concern, especially in shared production facilities. Prioritize brands committed to gluten-free practices to relish your sweets without worry. As with any gluten-free endeavor, communication is key, whether whipping up a batch in your kitchen or selecting a treat from your local bakery, making gluten-free dessert choices ensures your dessert time remains a delightful experience.
