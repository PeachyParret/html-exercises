        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <p>Pasta dough is finnicky so these amounts are just guidelines</p>
            <li>2 cups gluten-free all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 large eggs (About 1 egg per person)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the gluten-free all-purpose flour and salt.</li>
            <li>Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and crack the eggs into it. You'll see people on the internet do this on the table with a mound of flour, they're making life so much harder on themselves.</li>
            <li>Using a fork, gradually incorporate the flour into the eggs until a dough starts to form.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 5-8 minutes. Keep working until the dough starts sticking to your hand too much. Then add more flour. Repeat this until the dough only slighlty sticks to your hand.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. This allows the flour to fully hydrate.</li>
            <li>After resting, cut the dough into smaller portions. Take one portion and roll it out with a rolling pin until it reaches your desired thickness.</li>
            <li>As you roll the dough, it should feel smooth and elastic. If it's too sticky, add a bit more flour. If it's too dry and crumbly, add a touch of water.</li>
            <li>Once rolled out, you can cut the pasta into your preferred shape.</li>
            <li>Cook the gluten-free pasta in a pot of salted boiling water for 2-4 minutes, or until it reaches your desired level of doneness.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta and serve with your favorite gluten-free sauce (Like the one we're about to make next)!</li>

            <li>Cook the gluten-free pasta according to the instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sliced London Broil and cook until browned. Remove from the skillet and set aside.</li>
