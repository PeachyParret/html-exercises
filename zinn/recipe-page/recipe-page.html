    Note about the folder/filenaming: Consider how the '-page' is not adding much to the name, since it's assumed. So, I would remove it from your folders and files. And, perhaps, consider 'recipes' plural, since it includes multiple recipes.

                These h4 elements feel like subtitles that extend the h3s, rather than define a new subsection(s).

                Consider the following structure that retains the label for the section, but joins the heading with the subheading without suggesting that there's another subsection. Take or leave itâ€”just a thought. :-)

                Will you include ALL of the recipes on this one page? Or, are you considering some example recipe pages to keep this page shorter? I might suggest the latter, which you can add later.
                That way, you can create a common card pattern below that could be something like "Featured Intermediate Favorites"

                        two units to create typical card: image + title and description. Each with scope defined by those two divs
                        now, later with CSS, you can easily target these two children with each card to create a cool design. That anchor tag could be a CTA button
