            <p>
                There are over 100 different varieties of bread in the world today! Many of these can be put into sub-categories based on their ingredients or shape, like white, wheat, or flatbread. Different types of bread come from different regions of the world. A certain style of bread can arise simply because of what was available when people started making it. For example, challah comes from a region where oil is more widely used than butter, making it different from brioche. Here are some examples of those sub-categories:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>White:</strong> a bread made from flour that has been heavily processed
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Wheat:</strong> a bread with a bit more nutrients than white, but still made with refined white flour.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Whole Grain:</strong> a bread made with grains that remain fully intact, such as wheat, barley, and more.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Flatbread:</strong> a mixture of flour, water and salt, rolled flat and cooked. Some, like pita, may also include yeast.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sourdough:</strong> bread that achieves rise from fermentation instead of yeast. Any kind of bread can be sourdough, but the fermentation gives a slightly more sour taste than yeast.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Quick Bread:</strong> a type of bread that gets its rise from a chemical leavener such as baking powder or baking soda instead of from yeast or fermentation.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h2 id="reasons-to-eat-bread">So Why Should You Eat Bread?</h2>
            <p>
                It's good for you! <br>
                <br>
                Bread, especially that of the whole grain variety, contains a lot of important nutrients. Some kinds are fortified with calcium and iron, essential for maintaining healthy immune systems, energy, and bones. Bread is also a good source of fiber, which helps regulate our digestive system, keep blood sugar and cholesterol in check, and makes us feel full for longer. <br>
                <br>
                Most importantly, it's delicious!
