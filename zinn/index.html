            <p>
                There are over 100 different varieties of bread in the world today! Many of these can be put into sub-categories based on their ingredients or shape, like white, wheat, or flatbread. Different types of bread come from different regions of the world. A certain style of bread can arise simply because of what was available when people started making it. For example, challah comes from a region where oil is more widely used than butter, making it different from brioche. Here are some examples of those sub-categories:

        <h2 id="reasons-to-eat-bread">So Why Should You Eat Bread?</h2>
        <p>
            It's good for you! 
            <br><br>
            Bread, especially that of the whole grain variety, contains a lot of important nutrients. Some kinds are fortified with calcium and iron, essential for maintaining healthy immune systems, energy, and bones. Bread is also a good source of fiber, which helps regulate our digestive system, keep blood sugar and cholesterol in check, and makes us feel full for longer.

        <h2 id="reasons-to-make-your-own">Why Should You Make Your Own Bread?</h2>
        <p>
            For starters, it's delicious! Homemade bread is generally fresher (and better tasting) than what you can find in most grocery stores in the United States. 
            <br><br>
            By making your own bread, you can try out a variety of different recipesâ€”you might even be able to try types of bread that your usual stores don't sell!
            <br><br>
            When you bake your own loaves, you can customise them to suit your own tastes. That means you can add in (or omit) any ingredients you want to! It's a lot more expensive to buy a custom loaf from a bakery than it is to make one yourself.
            <br><br>
            Baking your own bread can give you a great sense of satisfaction! It can take some time, but at the end, you're left with a beautifully delicious loaf that makes all of your hard work worth it.
