            <p>
                Cleanser: Arguably the most important step to any skincare routine is finding a cleanser that works best for you. When deciding on a cleanser to purchase, ensure that the product mainly incorporates natural, non-abrasive ingredients, includes at least one active ingredient that is safe for daily use (i.e. niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, tranexamic acid, etc.), and that you complete a patch test on the inside of your wrist before applying it to the face.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moisturizer: A good cleanser and a moisturizer go hand in hand in even the simplest of routines. Your ideal moisturizer should provide consistent hydration to your skin without stripping it down, or in other cases, making it too oily. A general rule of thumb when choosing a moisturizer is to watch how your skin naturally acts in the day versus the night, and in the winter versus the summer. If you find yourself feeling oily in the day or in the summer heat, you may need a gel moisturizer. Contrastingly, if you find yourself having drier skin in the night and during the winter, you may need a cream-based moisturizer. Some people also have combination skin, which we will get into more detail later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sunscreen: You may be under the impression that you only need sunscreen on those hot days lying by the beach or pool. Unfortunately, that is simply not the truth. EVERYONE, no matter your age, requires daily sunscreen application in order to avoid serious skin issues down the road. Using an SPF of 50 or more provides your skin barrier with enough protection to withstand the sun's rays, even on those cloudy days. When choosing a daily sunscreen, ensure it does not include zinc oxide, as that ingredient can have harmful side effects.
