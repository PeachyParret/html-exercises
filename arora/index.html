            <p>
                Cleanser: Arguably the most important step to any skincare routine is finding a cleanser that works best for you. When deciding on a cleanser to purchase, ensure that the product mainly incorporates natural, non-abrasive ingredients, includes at least one active ingredient that is safe for daily use (i.e. niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, tranexamic acid, etc.), and that you complete a patch test on the inside of your wrist before applying it to the face.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moisturizer: A good cleanser and a moisturizer go hand in hand in even the simplest of routines. Your ideal moisturizer should provide consistent hydration to your skin without stripping it down, or in other cases, making it too oily. A general rule of thumb when choosing a moisturizer is to watch how your skin naturally acts in the day versus the night, and in the winter versus the summer. If you find yourself feeling oily in the day or in the summer heat, you may need a gel moisturizer. Contrastingly, if you find yourself having drier skin in the night and during the winter, you may need a cream-based moisturizer. Some people also have combination skin, which we will get into more detail later.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sunscreen: You may be under the impression that you only need sunscreen on those hot days lying by the beach or pool. Unfortunately, that is simply not the truth. EVERYONE, no matter your age, requires daily sunscreen application in order to avoid serious skin issues down the road. Using an SPF of 50 or more provides your skin barrier with enough protection to withstand the sun's rays, even on those cloudy days. When choosing a daily sunscreen, ensure it does not include zinc oxide, as that ingredient can have harmful side effects.

            <h3 id="howto-heading">How to Use Skincare Products</h3>
            <p>
                Moisturizer: Moisturizing is a fundamental step in any skincare routine. After cleansing your face, apply a small amount of moisturizer evenly to your skin. Gently massage it in using upward and outward motions. Make sure to choose a moisturizer that suits your skin type—whether you have dry, oily, or combination skin. For daytime use, opt for a lightweight, non-comedogenic moisturizer that provides hydration without making your skin feel greasy. At night, you can opt for a richer, cream-based moisturizer to replenish your skin while you sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sunscreen: Sunscreen is your best defense against premature aging and sun damage. Apply sunscreen generously to your face and any exposed skin areas, including your neck and ears, as part of your morning routine. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, and make sure to reapply it every two hours if you're spending time outdoors. Sunscreen should be the last step in your skincare routine before applying makeup. Don't forget to extend the protection to your lips with a lip balm that contains SPF.
            </p>
            <p>
                Serums: Serums are highly concentrated products designed to target specific skincare concerns, such as fine lines, dark spots, or hydration. They should be applied after cleansing and toning but before moisturizing. A little goes a long way with serums, so use just a few drops and gently press them into your skin. Allow the serum to fully absorb before applying your moisturizer. Choose serums with active ingredients that address your unique skin needs, like vitamin C for brightening or hyaluronic acid for hydration.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cleansers: Cleansing is the foundation of any skincare routine. Start with a gentle, sulfate-free cleanser that matches your skin type. Wet your face with lukewarm water, apply the cleanser, and gently massage it in using circular motions. Pay attention to areas prone to oiliness or makeup residue. Rinse your face thoroughly, ensuring there's no cleanser left on your skin. Pat your face dry with a clean towel; avoid rubbing, as it can irritate the skin. Cleansing should be done twice daily—once in the morning and again before bedtime—to keep your skin clean and refreshed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember that consistency is key when using these skincare products. Stick to a routine that works for your skin type, and don't forget to listen to your skin's needs. Over time, you'll notice improvements in your skin's texture, tone, and overall health.

            <h3 id="skintype-heading">Determine Your Skin Type</h3>
            <p>
                Determining your skin type is a crucial first step in crafting a personalized skincare routine. Your skin type influences the products you should use and the specific concerns you need to address. To help you identify your skin type, follow these simple steps:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Cleanse Your Face: Start with a clean slate. Wash your face gently with a mild cleanser to remove any makeup, dirt, or impurities.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Let Your Skin Rest: Allow your skin to breathe and return to its natural state. Refrain from applying any skincare products for a few hours.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Observe How Your Skin Feels: Pay attention to how your skin feels. Does it feel tight and dry, especially around the cheeks? Is it oily, particularly in the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin)? Or does it feel balanced, neither too oily nor too dry?
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Check for Shine: After a few hours, look at your skin. Is it shiny, particularly in the T-zone? Shiny skin often indicates excess oil production.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Assess Sensitivity: Note if your skin exhibits signs of sensitivity, such as redness, itching, or irritation when exposed to certain products or environmental factors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, let's delve into the most common skin types:
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Dry Skin: If your skin feels tight, rough, or flaky, and lacks natural oil, you likely have dry skin. Dry skin can benefit from gentle, hydrating products like creamy cleansers and rich moisturizers.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Oily Skin: Oily skin tends to feel greasy, particularly in the T-zone, and may be prone to acne or enlarged pores. Look for oil-free, non-comedogenic products to manage excess oil.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. Combination Skin: Combination skin features both dry and oily areas. Typically, the T-zone is oily, while the cheeks may be dry. Balancing products can help maintain harmony.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Normal Skin: Lucky you! Normal skin feels neither too oily nor too dry. It usually has a smooth texture and minimal sensitivity. A balanced skincare routine can help maintain its natural beauty.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. Sensitive Skin: Sensitive skin is prone to redness, irritation, and discomfort. It may react negatively to certain skincare ingredients. Opt for fragrance-free, hypoallergenic products designed for sensitive skin.
            </p>
            <p>
                By identifying your skin type, you can select products that cater to your specific needs and concerns, paving the way for a healthier, more radiant complexion. Remember that your skin type may change over time due to factors like climate, age, and lifestyle, so periodically reassess it to adapt your skincare routine accordingly.
