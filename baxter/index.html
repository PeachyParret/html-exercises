                    <h3>One thing a novice reader should know is that finding the right path to becoming an avid reader is different for everyone. It can be as simple as reading one short story piece from the paper every morning. Starting out does not mean tackling a 1000-page memoir.</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Find your niche.
                            There are hundreds or genres and subgenres, so finding a place where a story speaks to you is not hard at all. Sifting through those genres might be slightly time consuming, and it is a process of trial and error. However, one you find your niche reading won’t be something that you just do, it will become something you enjoy.
                        </li>
                        <li>Create your space.
                            Finding a calm relaxing space to read is very important. This doesn’t mean that you can’t read in a busy park on a Saturday, or while riding the bus home from work. Each person has a different tolerance limit to noise and distraction while reading. Discover this for yourself, test different spaces out. Find your home for reading.
                        </li>
                        <li>Make time.
                            Finding the time in the day to sit down and really invest in a novel just wont work in today's age. Everyone is coming and going, busy schedules everywhere. Some of the best times to carve out time for reading is before bed, while winding down. Or you can be creative and including reading into tasks where you might not think to pick up a book. For instance, going on a run at the gym, maybe bring a book along. See what can happen.
