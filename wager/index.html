  High level Items
  - Remove all of those spaces after an opening tag and just before the closing tags
  - For the midterm, all images should use the four attributes: src, alt, width, height, and srcset
  - ID attributes should be lowercase with no whitespaces; use hyphens between words.
  - ID attributes are not needed, if you don't need to target the element. So, the nav element doesn't need an ID right now.
  - Check your indentation scheme throughout to represent the hierarchical relationships
  - we're going to learn later why we avoiv inline CSS styling, so be aware that those parts will need to be removed eventually
