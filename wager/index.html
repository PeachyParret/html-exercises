          <p>Leo is my older dog and he is very big and sort of scary looking but I promise he is really sweet. He likes to sit on you because it's more comfortable for him than sitting on the floor, and since he weighs a lot you might complain but he doesn't get why you wouldn't want him to sit there.</p>
